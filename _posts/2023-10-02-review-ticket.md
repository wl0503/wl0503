## Review Ticket
- .5 point: Have a working HTML code cell in a notebook based on the wireframe representation provided under HTML hacks (HTML Hack)
Ans: Since I have the HTML code, which has the exact format of the wireframe that hack requires, I think I deserve 0.5 here.

- .5 point: Have a working javascript code cell in a notebook which creates, manipulates, and logs an object (Data Types Hack)
Ans: I satisfied every hack condition by using array in js that hack requires me to do. This part of hack worth 0.5 for me. 

- .5 point: Have a working javascript code cell in a notebook which modifies elements in the first HTML code cell hack or another HTML code cell based on the same wireframe representation (DOM Hack)
Ans: I satisfie DOM hack with HTML using JS. But during the process of completing hacks, I was unsure about how function works after I click the button to ensure that links get switched. So, I used chatgpt a little bit. Thus, I think I can get 0.4 for this hack. 

- .5 point: Have a working javascript code cell in a notebook which compares two variables (Javascript Hack) 
Ans: This is the most easiest one like the first HTML hack. All I had to do was just to compare two variables with using if and else statement. I satisfied everything the hack requires me since it was easy to do. Thus, I deserve 0.5 in this hack. 

- .5 point: Have code cells in a notebook which shows the corrections made to the first three code cells in the 1.4 correcting errors page (Correcting Errors Hack)
Ans: Same case as the third hack, meaning since it was bit hard for me to explain the errors and correction I make, I used chatgpt a little bit. So, I think I dont deserve 0.5 in this hack, but 0.4
