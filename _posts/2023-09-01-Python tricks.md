## Emoji print
- You can easily add emojis to your Python code using the emoji library. First, install it with pip install emoji.
Use the emojize function to add emojis to your text.

## Extracting Data:
- The newspaper3k library allows you to extract articles from websites. Install it with pip install newspaper3k.

## Wikipedia Search:
- You can use the wikipedia library to search for and retrieve information from Wikipedia. Install it with pip install wikipedia.
Search for specific terms and display their summaries.

## Inspecting a Function:
- The inspect module can help you explore the source code of Python functions and objects.
You can use it to inspect the source code of functions, such as those from third-party libraries.

## Python Data Types:
- Python has dynamic typing, meaning variable types are determined at runtime.
Strong typing implies that variable types matter when performing operations.
You can use type hints in Python to specify types, but they are not always necessary.

## Mean Function:
- An example of a function called mean is provided. It calculates the mean of a list of scores.
The function uses type hints to specify the expected types of input.
Two inner functions, average and average2, calculate the average differently.
The code handles both single values and lists of scores.
