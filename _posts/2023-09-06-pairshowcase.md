description: This page is established to explain our(I and my partner) plan for pair showcase. 
type: plans
courses: { compsci: {week: 3} }
---

Discuss process of installing tools: go over hacks focusing on Tool Setup (ex: installing Python, VSCode, Homebrew…) and Github Pages/Blog Setup
Discuss challenges and obstacles faced in these processes
Ex: commands not working, confusion (lack of fully clear idea of goal/what to do), required software 
Since we first starting creating the lab notebook logging our accomplishments past the first week, we had to go back through sources such as Slack and Canvas to jog our memory on weekly progress from before
Discuss how we learned more about managing repositories in the process of transferring data when we had to make a new one due to updates
Quickly review through plans and then review tickets, discussing what they are and briefly going over the information inside each link
Go through each hack, beginning with Snake Game then to the Game of Life, afterwards moving to the Python Quiz then Calculator and finally to the [extra game/function]
For each, discuss the process of editing code to make them personalized (what we did, how we did it…) to demonstrate learning better
