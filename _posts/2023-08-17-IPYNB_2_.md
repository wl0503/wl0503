## Comparison of College Board Pseudo Code to Python with Descriptions
- Output: Pseudo Code: DISPLAY(expression)
Python: print(expression, end=" ")
Purpose: Display the value of the expression, followed by a space.

- input: Pseudo Code: a ← INPUT()
Python: a = input(prompt)
Purpose: Accept a value from the user and assign it to the variable a.

- assignments: Pseudo Code: a ← expression
Python: a = expression
Purpose: Evaluate the expression and assign the result to the variable a

- selection: Pseudo Code: IF (expression)
Python: if expression:
Purpose: Run commands in the code block associated with the selection if the expression is true.

- Iteration n times: Pseudo Code: REPEAT n TIMES
Python: for i in range(n):
Purpose: Repeat commands in the code block associated with the iteration n times.

- Iteration expression: Pseudo Code: REPEAT UNTIL (expression)
Python: while expression:
Purpose: Repeat commands in the code block associated with the iteration while the expression is true.

- List assignments: Pseudo Code: list ← [expression1, expression2, expression3]
Python: list = [expression1, expression2, expression3]
Purpose: Assign values to a list, where values can be literals or expressions.

- First index in list: Pseudo Code: list[1]
Python: list[0]
Purpose: Access the first element in the list (Python and many programming languages use 0-based indexing).

- Last index in list: Pseudo Code: list[LENGTH(list)]
Python: list[len(list) - 1]
Purpose: Access the last element in the list.

- Define procedure: Pseudo Code: PROCEDURE name (parameter)
Python: def name(parameter):
Purpose: Create a procedure (function) containing a sequence of programming instructions.

- Expression equals: Pseudo Code: a = b
Python: a == b
Purpose: Evaluate if the assigned value of a equals the assigned value of b.

- Expression not equals: Pseudo Code: a ≠ b
Python: a != b
Purpose: Evaluate if the assigned value of a is NOT equal to the assigned value of b.


## Pseudo Code IF Code Block:
Pseudo Code: 
a ← 1
b ← 1

IF (a = b) {
   DISPLAY("A equals B")
}
Python equivalent:
a = 1
b = 1
if (a == b):
    print("A equals B")
Output:
A equals B

## Definitions: 
Code Block: A section of code enclosed by specific syntax (e.g., {} in Pseudo Code or indentation in Python) that groups together statements to be executed together.

Sequence: A set of instructions or commands executed one after the other in the order they are written.

Selection: The process of making a decision in code based on the evaluation of a condition. It involves executing different code blocks depending on whether the condition is true or false.

Iteration: The act of repeating a set of instructions or code block multiple times, either for a specific number of iterations or until a certain condition is met.
