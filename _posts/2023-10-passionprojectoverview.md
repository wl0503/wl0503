# Product Owner's Background and Ideas:

- The Product Owner (the teacher) seeks projects that align with College Board Big Ideas, Collaboration, and Data concepts.
The project should be a passion project that leverages topics like binary counting visualization/games, image manipulation (e.g., grayscale, sizing), and machine learning.
The project involves several layers of investigation, including API design, frontend development related to binary, backend development with data compression, machine learning, and deployment.
Project Ideas Include:

# API Design:

- Creating a Jokes API and a Covid API.
Frontend/Binary:

- Learning and using binary for frontend development.
Adding features like binary labels under each bit, creating a binary calculator, and demonstrating how binary represents colors.
Combining elements of the Game of Life, binary, and colors to create a tool for binary sketching and teaching.
Backend/Data Compression:

- Developing a project inspired by Lassen National Park with features like blur, grayscale, and more.
Implementing functions for red, blue, and green scale.
Enabling image uploads, base64 API transport, and image persistence on the server.
Backend/ML (Machine Learning):

- Leveraging the vast opportunities in machine learning with dynamic and immersive learning models.
The focus is on user-provided data to enhance the learning model in a short demo.
Deployment:

- Emphasizing the importance of version control, creating READMEs, and deploying projects (e.g., using AWS).
Projects should be shared and accessible for wider use.
Realizations and Adjustments:

- The project encourages equity and the involvement of all team members.
Suggested roles include Python and Jupyter Notebook researchers, JavaScript developers, scrum masters or lead programmers, and those working on foundational components.
Collaboration and responsiveness are key aspects of teamwork.
Project Requirements:

- The theme for the 1st Trimester Passion Project is "Learning JavaScript and Python for College Board and as a Team."
The project must feature JavaScript for the frontend and Python for the backend.
Backend components should include APIs.
An emphasis is placed on College Board's Big Idea 2 - Data.
Students are required to provide evidence of their contributions through GitHub analytics.
Evidence of completing team goals and objectives is mandatory.
The team must demonstrate collaboration, particularly at the Ideation Checkpoint.
Design and data design should be evident, possibly using tools like Figma, Canva, or draw.io.
GitHub Issues should be used and managed as part of the project.
The project should start with repository setup and backend deployment using AWS.
