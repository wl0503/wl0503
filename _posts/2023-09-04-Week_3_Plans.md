### PBL Unit 1 / Week 3
Daily goals for week 3
- Monday: start by exploring the HTML structure of the grade calculator project. I'll look for key HTML elements, understanding how they form the core of my calculator.
- Tuesday: Dive into the JavaScript function newInputLine(index), which dynamically creates labels and input elements as I use the calculator. This function adds to the calculator's interactive nature.
- Wednesday: Focus on the calculator(event) function, the calculator's heart. It will handle calculations and work with input elements, making it easier for me to process user-provided data.
- Thursday: Explore the process of integrating JavaScript into HTML, recognizing the seamless synergy between these two technologies. I investigate event triggers, particularly key events, enabling real-time responses to user inputs and actions in the grade calculator.
- Friday: Dedicate this day to creating a fully functional grade calculator within an HTML environment. I apply the knowledge acquired throughout the week and experiment with sample inputs to ensure the calculator's robust functionality, delivering an intuitive user experience.
