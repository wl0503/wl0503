### struggles of week 3
- Week 3 is mainly about Javascript and javascript was hard to understand than the python.
- Codes in javascript was very complicated, making me struggle with it.  
- I thought input and output in Java would be easy to understand like the case of Python, but they were sophisticated system of input and output values. 

### sumary of accomplishments of week 3
- I began to use office hours in earnest to ask questions since week 3. 
- With my friend's help, I made a HTML table in JS and applied it to my lab notebook.
- I tried to find out how Javascript code functions compared to Python.
