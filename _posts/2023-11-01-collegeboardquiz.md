# topic 3.1. skill 4b
- Answer: B. The code segment assigns the initial value of first to temp, then assigns the initial value of second to first. The initial value of first, which has been stored in temp, is then assigned to second. Therefore, the initial values of first and second have been interchanged.

# topic 2.3. skill 5b
- Answer: B. The number of photos taken at a particular geographic location can be determined from the geographic data stored with each photo. The number of photos taken in the last year can be determined from the data and time data stored with each photo. The name of the person who took a photo is not captured in the photo data.

# topic 3.9 skill 1d
- Answer: C. The programs each display ten values, but each value displayed by program B is one greater than the corresponding value from program A. Program A displays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and program B displays  2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11.

# topic 3.9 skill 2b
- Answer: B. This Boolean expression evaluates to true when counter (the number of temperatures greater than or equal to 90) is greater than 50% of total (the number of entries in the list).

# topic 2.2 skill 1d
- Answer: B. It is not possible to use byte pair encoding in the string Open quotation, LEVEL, underscore, UP, close quotationbecause no pair of characters appears in the string more than once.

# topic 3.6 skill 2b
- Answer: A. This code segment rotates right whenever there is an open square to the right. The robot will move forward from its initial location to the upper-left corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move down two squares, then rotate right, then move forward to the gray square.

# topic 3.5 skill 2b
- Answer A. With these inputs, the AND gate will produce an output of false and the first OR gate will produce an output of false. Since both inputs to the second OR gate will be false, the circuit will have an output of false.

# topic 3.17 skill id
- Answer: D. Each call to the Analysis procedure requires one hour of program execution time. The procedure is called
once before the loop, and then four times inside the loop (once for each of the four entries in One word, genre List). Therefore, the program will take approximately 5 hours to execute.


# topic 3.9 skill 1d
- Answer: C. Program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward, and rotating right. Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the upper-left corner of the grid.

# topic 5.5 skill 5e
- Answer: D. Creative Commons licenses can be used by creators of digital music to specify how the samples can be used by others. A no-rights-reserved license allows others to freely make use of the samples.

# topic 3.9 skill 1d
- Answer: B. Both code segments display the correct average. Code segment I requires more arithmetic operations because it performs the operation sum divided by LENGTH, open parenthesis, num List, close parenthesis within the loop, while code segment II performs the same operation only once.

# topic 3.3 skill 4b
- Answer: C. The expression count, MOD, 10 equals 0 evaluates to true when count is a multiple of 1 0, and so this code segment sets cost to 0 under the appropriate conditions.

# topic 2.4 skill 2b
- Answer: B. This expression uses theMax procedure to replace the midterm score with the higher of the two scores. The selected value is then added to the final exam score and assigned to One word, adjusted Total.
