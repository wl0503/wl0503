### The plan for Tri 2 CS
- Starting from the second semester, I promise to record what I learn each day. Currently, I use a timebox method to record what I've learned every week, but I feel that a week is not enough, based on my experiences from the first semester. So, my first goal for the upcoming second semester is to record daily learning activities. The second goal, although it sounds obvious, is to focus on lectures during class time to avoid falling behind. Lastly, the most important goal for me is to work on projects and not procrastinate during the second semester whenever possible.
