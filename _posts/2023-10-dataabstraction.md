- Pandas is introduced as a valuable tool for data validation, data analysis, and understanding College Board topics.
Files To Get:

- You are provided with links to download Jupyter Notebook files, data files (CSV and JSON), and images related to the lesson.
Pandas and DataFrames:

- he concept of DataFrames in Pandas is explained. DataFrames are used to store and manipulate tabular data.
Cleaning Data:

- The importance of data cleaning is discussed, including identifying missing, invalid, or inaccurate data.
Extracting Info:

- Various operations on Pandas DataFrames are demonstrated, including extracting specific columns, sorting data, and filtering data based on criteria.
Creating DataFrames:

- How to create Pandas DataFrames using Python dictionaries is shown. Data can be stored as a dictionary and converted into a DataFrame.
Examine DataFrame Rows:

- Examples of how to examine specific rows or individual rows of a DataFrame.
Pandas DataFrame Information:

- Demonstrates how to obtain information about the DataFrame, including data types and memory usage.
Working with Larger Datasets:

- Loading and sorting a larger dataset from a CSV file.
Working with 3rd Party APIs:

- How to fetch data from a 3rd-party API, convert it into a DataFrame, and manipulate it.
Hack Helpers:

- Suggestions for datasets suitable for learning Pandas, including examples like the Titanic dataset, Iris dataset, NBA player stats, housing prices dataset, COVID-19 dataset, and World Bank dataset.
Machine Learning:

- Using Scikit-learn, this part covers how to train machine learning models (Decision Tree Classifier and Logistic Regression) and evaluate their accuracy using a Titanic dataset. It's a brief introduction to machine learning.
