### Struggles of Week 0
- I was new at coding, so it was hard to understand the article. 
- I was absent, so I missed the lesson on Thursday and Friday. 
- Missing two lessons made me struggle with the installation process. 
- I couldn't find anyone to help me about my tool set up during the weekdays. 

### summary of accomplishments of week 0
- Even though I didn't finigh the whole installation process, I installed github, vscode, and docker. 
- I asked for help to my friends in the weekend. 
- I tried to catch up the class as possible as I could by finishing up the some of the installation process with my friend.
