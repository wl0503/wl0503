## Week from 1 to 3
- Tools and Software Development Processes
1. I gained hands-on experience in various activities, including blogging, coding using Jupyter Notebooks, and creating content on GitHub Pages.
2. I completed setting up Vscode and github page, and learned the usage of terminal. 
3. I organized the timebox and learned the basic concepts of two languages: python and Javscript. 
4. Especially, in terms of weekly plans and review tickets, I and my partner, Tucker G got live reviews and performed some projects such as pair programming and pair showcase
5. Week from 1 to 3 was the most hardest time to adapt to the class as I was new at coding, but I overcame this through collaboration and asking questions. 

## Week from 4 to 10
- Web Development Layers, Web Application, Data, and N@tM
1. From week 4, it was for us to start code code code in earnest, and we learned about dealing with data and correcting errors.
2. Compared to week from 1 to 3, we began to delve into more advanced unit such as mastering binary, python/flask, and AWS deployment usage. For me, especially AWS deployment was the most hardest one through the class activity, making me spend roughly 3 weeks to finish it. 
3. Rather than getting review of tool check such as github page establishment, and blogging, this week, we mainly focused on the review such as coding: Ex. Js basics test, PP iteration check.
4. The new activiy, team teaching was introduced into this week, giving me a chance to learn about a variety of python codes. 
5. We had divided each member's roles and had worked on the biggest project for weeks, the Passion Project and finally showed the final completion of the project at the night at the museum.
6. I completed every quiz on the college board to fully prepare for the AP exam and also made some notes about those problems I got wrong on the colleg board quiz.
